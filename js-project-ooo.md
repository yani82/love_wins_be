# JS/Rails Order of Operations Guide

The JavaScript Project repo has a handful of helpful READMEs that outline the requirements for the JS/Rails Project along with project planning tips and a note about what to expect during your review. There is also this JavaScript Rails API Project Setup README that provides a thorough step by step walkthrough to get your project up and running along with some help OOJS refactoring tips. Lastly, we also wanted to outline a suggested flow of execution to aide you in building your project. We put together this "Order of Operations Guide" for organizing and completing your JS/Rails Project. This guide is based on the 4-part project build. All study groups can be found here.

The application we will create during the project build series is a "Syllabus Sharing App" for independent study.

**USER STORY: A user should be able to read and create syllabi based on category**

## Checklist

### PART 1: Planning and Building a Rails API

**BEFORE YOU CODE**

- [x] 1. Check project requirements in JavaScript READMEs
- [x] 2. Ideate! What do you want to build?
choose a domain you're familiar with!
choose a domain you care about
- [x] 3. Wireframing & User Stories
Write down your models, their attributes, and their associations
"As a user, I can ....."
"A user should be able to ....."
What does your app do?
- [x] 4. Design your MVP = 'Minimum Viable Product' vs. what are my 'stretch goals'
Stretch goals - bonus features you want but don't need
NOW WE'RE READY FOR PROJECT SET UP

- [x] 5. Generate new Rails API using rails new <my_app_name> --database=postgresql --api
(Replace <my_app_name> with the actual name of your project)
- [x] 6. Create github repo
- [x] 7. Create a new branch for building out models `git co -b <branch_name>`. This way you can always go back to the fresh API.
NOTE: It is best practice to always create a new branch when working on a new feature/edit to your code. Your master branch should only have working code. Debug in a branch, not in master.
NOW WE'RE READY TO CODE (BUT JUST OUR MODELS â€” NO CONTROLLERS OR SERIALIZERS YET)

NOTE: Remember to VERTICALLY build your MVP! This means building out one model/feature at a time. DO NOT build out all the models and controllers at the same time. This is the easiest way to get lost in your project very early. Read more about this here.

- [] 8. Build your models
Migrations
Model classes
Associations
- [] 9. Test your models and associations in the console
Create some seed data
Adjust migrations as needed
PART 2: Routes, Controllers, Serializers
- [] 1. Name spaced routes
- [] 2. Controllers rendering JSON based on routes
- [] 3. Fast JSON Serializer

Bonus
- [] Leverage a CSS framework to improve the styling of your application
Easiest to implement: Bulma
Most popular: Bootstrap
Also good: Semantic UI
Not bootstrap: Materialize
Confirm
- [] You have a large number of small Git commits
- [] Your commit messages are meaningful
- [] You made the changes in a commit that relate to the commit message
- [] You don't include changes in a commit that aren't related to the commit message
